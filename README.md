## Credit and Collaborations

What hours will you be available to communicate?

→ Normal lab hours: 1:30 PM to 6PM, possibly with not-guaranteed availability later at night

What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

→ Slack, Remo

How often will you take breaks?

→ Every 60 – 90 minutes

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

→ We will extend our working hours to address any deficits.

 Cooperative
 
Make a list of each person’s strengths.

→ Micha:

Coding technical skill

Technical problem solving

→ Lauren:

Fast learner

Positive outlook/enthusiastic

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

→ We will change navigators/drivers according to whose strengths appear to be the most relevant to the current situation.

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

→ Micha: Develop organization and planning

→ Lauren: Improve prioritization and thoroughness

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

→ Because of our driver/navigator role system, we will both be looking at every line of code. We will also have a morning code review wherein we re-analyze the code from the prior day to ensure we are both on the same page.

 Conflict Resolution
 
What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

→ By monitoring the work distribution on an ongoing basis, we will try to ensure an even workload. Any discrepancies will be addressed as soon as possible.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

→ By maintaining clear and open communication, as above, we will address any potential issues as they happen.

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

→ We will both be ready to ask questions if either of us does not understand a system or process.
